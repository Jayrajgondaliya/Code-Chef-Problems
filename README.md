# Code-Chef-Problems

This is practice repository where I will be adding solutions of problems from CodeChef solved by me.

- Each file will be independent file, can be run directly using commands 
	- Ex: 
		- 	javac <file>.java - To compile and generate .class file
		- 	java <file> - to run java file.
			- after this need to provide input process and generate output - Read description for inputs becuase each problem will have different input values.

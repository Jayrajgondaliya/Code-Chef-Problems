# Code-Chef-Problems

This is practice repository where I will be adding solutions of problems from CodeChef solved by me.

- Each file will be independent file, can be run directly using commands 
	- Ex: 
		- 	javac <file>.java - To compile and generate .class file
		- 	java <file> - to run java file.
			- after this need to provide input process and generate output - Read description for inputs becuase each problem will have different input values.
		

- Repository will be divided into 4 sections 
	1. Beginner
	2. Easy
	3. Medium 
	4. Hard


> **_NOTE:_**  All Problems can have multiple solutions - not necessory, povided solutions here is best - this can be better.

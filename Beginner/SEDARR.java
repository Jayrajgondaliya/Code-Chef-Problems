/*

The special task force Sed managed to obtain a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,AN.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any element of the current sequence and replace it by any positive integer.
You need to make the sum of the elements of the sequence divisible by a given positive integer K. Find the minimum number of operations you need to perform to achieve this.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum required number of operations.

Constraints
1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤100
1≤K≤105
1≤Ai≤105 for each valid i
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Example Input
3
3 2
1 1 1
3 3
1 1 1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
Example Output
1
0
0
Explanation
Example case 1: Initially, 1+1+1=3 is not divisible by K=2. We can change A1 to 2. Now, 2+1+1=4 is divisible by K.

Example case 2: For the initial sequence A, 1+1+1=3 is already divisible by K=3, so no operations are required.

Example case 3: Again, for the initial sequence A, 1+2+3+4+5=15 is already divisible by K=5, so no operations are required.
